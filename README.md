# plastic-monitor
PLASTIC MONITOR contains Python code for analysing images from a time-lapse camera.
It is a prototype software for extracting statistics on floating debris, and this research version was developed at Deltares. 
Source code is available at https://github.com/Deltares/plastic-monitor, contact is Marieke Eleveld (marieke.eleveld@deltares.nl).

Complementary results from an analysis of satellite images can be found at http://deltaresdata.openearth.eu/thredds/catalog/plastic_monitor/catalog.html
A script to illustrate te basics behind visualising Sentinel-1 GRD data and to exporting a geotiff is available as https://code.earthengine.google.com/97d8b8997ace92417a1dc5a27d7b745e

All code was developed for research, and is distributed under the MIT license (without any warrantee) in the hope that it can be useful.
